MIT/GNU Scheme Slackbuild

From the website:

 "MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming
  language, providing an interpreter, compiler, source-code debugger,
  integrated Emacs-like editor, and a large runtime library. MIT/GNU
  Scheme is best suited to programming large applications with a rapid
  development cycle."

This package was interesting to me because I've been playing along
with the Opencourseware version of MIT's Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs course, available at:

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/

Both the Scheme machine and the Edwin editor (a much older version of
which is used in the videos) are included in the package.

Have fun!
