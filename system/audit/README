Audit for Slackware

The Linux Auditing System is a kernel subsystem the allows the kernel
to record events of interest to intrusion detection systems, such as
file access attempts, specific system calls, or custom events
generated by trusted system binaries like login or sshd. The audit
package provides the tools to configure the audit system, and to
collect and process its output.

From the auditd man page:

 auditd is the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's
 responsible for writing audit records to the disk. Viewing the logs is
 done with the ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring the audit
 rules is done with the auditctl utility. During startup, the rules in
 /etc/audit.rules are read by auditctl. The audit daemon itself has
 some configuration options that the admin may wish to customize. They
 are found in the auditd.conf file.

To collect audit events, your kernel must have the audit system
enabled. To check, say:

bailey@mahnmut:/$ zgrep -i audit /proc/config.gz
CONFIG_AUDIT_ARCH=y
CONFIG_AUDIT=y
CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL=y
CONFIG_AUDIT_TREE=y

The audit package has no other dependencies. However, certain audit
events of interest, such as failed login attempts from /bin/login,
password changes, etc. are generated by their respective binaries
using libaudit. If your site policy requires auditing those events,
some reconfiguration and/or patching may be required.

Most distributions that provide audit also implement SELinux with
auditd configured to record SELinux events, but SELinux is not
required to audit kernel events.
