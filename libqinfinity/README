libqinfinity.Slackbuild, Andy Bailey <bailey@akamai.com>

This is a Slackbuild script for libqinfinity, a Qt-style interface to
libinfinity, used by Kobby.

You'll need to install the libinfinity Slackbuild to create this
package. libinfinity also requires libgsasl, so if you're fetching SBo
dependencies, get that one, too.
