# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zile: zile (zile is lossy emacs)
zile:
zile: GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for Zile Is
zile: Lossy Emacs. Zile has been written to be as similar as possible to
zile: Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home.
zile:
zile: Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit clean
zile: (though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the number of editing
zile: buffers and windows is only limited by available memory and screen
zile: space respectively. Registers, minibuffer completion and auto fill are
zile: available. Function and variable names are identical with Emacs's.
