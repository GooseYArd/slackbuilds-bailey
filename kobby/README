kobby.Slackbuild, bailey@akamai.com

This is a Slackbuild for kobby, a collaborative editor for KDE,
similar to gobby.

To build this package will require libqinfinity, libinfinity, and
libgsasl, all available from SBo.

Note: the "inifinoted" daemon, required for collaborative sessions, is
included with the libinfinity Slackbuild.
